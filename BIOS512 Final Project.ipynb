    "I was first interested in exploring the types of diets US adults follow. There were 7,625 adults aged 18 to 79 for whom diet could be determined based on their NHANES responses. Around 83% of those respondents did not indicate following any type of special diet (deemed as \"regular\" in the above figure). Since this constitutes the vast majority of observations, I wanted to look into special diets alone while still displaying the breakdown of just regular vs special diet to provide a sense of scale. Among the approximately 17% who did follow some special diet, a weight loss diet was by far the most common (n = 613), followed by multiple diets (n = 197) and diabetic diet (n = 150), then low sodium, low carb, and low fat diets. One thing to note is that respondents were able to select multiple options on the special diet question, meaning that diet had to be recoded to account for this. Unfortunately, the consequence is that the exact combinations of multiple diets became obscured. Nonetheless, the top diets generally reflect a pattern among US adults in adopting special diets that presumably aligns with addressing potential health concerns, such as diabetes or CVD.\n",

    "Protein consumption is an aspect of nutrition I thought may be valuable to investigate due to preconceived notions regarding gender differences. To be able to explore this relationship, I merged variables from the NHANES demographics and nutrient intake datasets. Plotting all the values for percent daily protein intake by gender category reveals relatively similar distribution of values among this sample. The median for males is 19.3% compared to 18.4% for females. Median percent daily protein intake for both males and females falls squarely within the recommended daily percentage of 10-35%. There seems to be a greater proportion of males that are outliers, whose protein consumption falls well above the recommended maximum.\n",

Creatinine levels are somewhat affected by protein. Additionally, factoring in diet may help elucidate the distribution of creatinine levels. The figures above illustrate how a larger percentage of respondents on regular diets and other non-weight loss diets have higher creatinine levels, whereas all those on the weight loss diet had creatinine levels below about 22,000 µmol/L.\n"
